'Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. The most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox '

          ' reptiles and birds. They may also eat eggs and vegetation. Many species are generalist predators, but some (such as the '
          'crab-eating fox) have more specialized diets. Most species of fox consume around 1 kg (2.2 lb) of food every day. '
          'Foxes cache excess food, burying it for later consumption, usually under leaves, snow, or soil.[9][15] While hunting, '

          'then use their hind legs to leap up with great force and land on top of their chosen prey.[2] Using their pronounced canine teeth,'
